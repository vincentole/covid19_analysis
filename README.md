# Covid19 Analysis

This is an experimental analysis of COVID-19 using R and the packages listed below.

This project is for my personal learning, however, anyone who is also studying data science might find this helpful.

I demonstrate how you can tidy, transform, and visualize data for a time series problem.

Packages:
* tidycovid19 by Joachim Gassen.
* https://github.com/joachim-gassen/tidycovid19
